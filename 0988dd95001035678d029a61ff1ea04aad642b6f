      "message": "Yes, we need to label them ourselves if we want it to be any more fine-grained than this, and we would also need to make sure nothing else is adversely impacted. I don\u0027t know if we should bother -- what do you think? We are already able to bypass this for `write` commands when we disable USB data.\n\nAlso: it doesn\u0027t run as `nobody`. I should probably clarify the init files, because the onrestart actions aren\u0027t subject to the user and group, only the service command itself is. So `linkerconfig --help` is running as nobody. The `exec`, unless otherwise specified, I believe runs as root.\n\n\u003e Currently defaults to root. (??? probably should default to nobody)\n\n^ From https://android.googlesource.com/platform/system/core/+/refs/heads/master/init/README.md\n\n(That is describing the `user` value, but I think it\u0027s also the default for `exec` and friends.)",
